    <h1>Why plant trees?</h1>
    <h3>Trees help clean the air we breathe, filter the water we drink, and provide habitat to over 80% of the world's terrestrial biodiversity.
        Forests provide jobs to over 1.6 billion people, absorb harmful carbon from the atmosphere, and are key ingredients in 25% of all medicines. Have you ever taken an Aspirin? It comes from the bark of a tree!</h3>
    <h1>How can plants help reduce global warming?</h1>
    <h3>Plants, through photosynthesis, and soils sequester roughly a third of carbon dioxide emissions released into the atmosphere each decade from the burning of fossil fuels. During photosynthesis, plants open tiny pores on their leaf surfaces to suck carbon dioxide from the air and produce their own food.</h3>

    <h1>How many plants prevent global warming?</h1>
    <h3>A single mature tree, meanwhile, may take in about 50 pounds of carbon dioxide per year. At this rate, it would take 640 trees per person to account for all American emissions, which adds up to more than 200 billion trees.</h3>
    <br>
    <h1>how can trees save Earth form global warming?</h1>
    <h3>As trees grow, they help stop climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the air, storing carbon in the trees and soil, and releasing oxygen into the atmosphere.Trees and vegetation lower surface and air temperatures by providing shade and through evapotranspiration. Shaded surfaces, for example, may be 20–45°F (11–25°C) cooler than the peak temperatures of unshaded materials.</h3>

    <h1>What is the importance of plant biodiversity?</h1>
    <h3>A flourishing forest provides food, shelter and clean air and water to support a wide range of species. Within a forest, biodiversity refers to everything from the earthworms and bugs burrowed in the soil, to the land animals foraging on the ground, to the squirrels and birds in the trees.Plant biodiversity is invaluable because it balances ecosystems, protects watersheds, mitigates erosion, moderates climate, and provides shelter for animals. Threats to plant biodiversity include the increasing human population, pollution, deforestation, and species extinction.</h3>

    <h1>And also you can keep your plants inside your house</h1>
    <h3>Indoor plants are popular because they are relatively easy to take care of, provide health benefits and can be used in a variety of indoor décor themes. Indoor plants are a great option for those who have little yard space for an outdoor garden or for those who live in climates with severely cold winters.Indoor plants offer two potential benefits for us: improved psychological (mental) well-being and improved physical human health (i.e. they support fitness and general health). The psychological benefits of indoor plants have been shown as: An improved mood. Reduced stress levels.</h3>
